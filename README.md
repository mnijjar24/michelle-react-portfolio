## Welcome to the React Portfolio

The react portfolio application was created so that employers who are looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications can view potential employee's work samples and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position. When this portfolio is loaded, then the user is presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer. When the header is viewed, then the user gets presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio which include: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. When the navigation title is clicked on, then the user is presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted. Also, the the portfolio is loaded, then the About Me title and section are selected by default. When the user is presented with the About Me section, then a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them is shown. In the Portfolio section, six of the developerâ€™s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository are presented. In the contact section, there are fields to enter name, an email address, and a message. If the cursor is moved out of the form fields without entering text, then the user receives a notification that this field is required. When text is entered into the email address field, then a notification is recieved that an invalid email address is entered. Overall, this is an amazing application for employees to seek for the potential employee for a position!
